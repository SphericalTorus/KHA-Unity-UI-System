## KHA Unity UI System

The **KHA Unity UI System** is a package for Unity engine designed to make your work with UI simple and convenient from the code side.

The system’s key features include:

- A convenient mechanism for displaying and closing UI elements with a single line of code.
- Automatic support for correct layers for all UI elements.
- Flexible and extensible system of animated transitions between UI entities.

By using the system, you don’t have to worry about the mechanism of showing, hiding, or maintaining UI elements in a correct state. Handle the creation of content for user interface in your project, and the system will take care of the rest.

The system doesn’t impose any specific architectural pattern; you can use MVC, MVP, MVVM, or any other approach at your discretion. It is also independent of third-party plugins and can be seamlessly integrated into any project. However, there is a version that includes DOTween, if you choose it as the main tool for your UI animations.
